# Clean all previous HTTPS dotnet certificates:
dotnet dev-certs https --clean

dotnet dev-certs https
dotnet dev-certs https --trust

# Generate new HTTPS dotnet certificate to the desired location:
sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep ~/Desktop/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.crt --format PEM

# Import it system-wide and trust:
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! does not work !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --> sudo cp ~/Desktop/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.crt /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors

sudo trust anchor --store ~/Desktop/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.crt
sudo update-ca-trust





























# SPOILDER: DID NOT WORK ...
# ... and now, a week later, the final fix for the proper dotnet-to-dotnet work is the following:
sudo cp ~/Desktop/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.crt /etc/ssl/certs/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.pem

# ... and just in case:
sudo update-ca-trust







# Also did not work:
sudo cp ~/Desktop/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.crt /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.pem
sudo cp ~/Desktop/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.crt /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/dotnetDevHttpsSanyaCert.crt
sudo update-ca-trust
