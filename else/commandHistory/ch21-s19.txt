# Don't forget that from this moment on, after each change in the Angular code, you need to run 'ng build' to re-create static files for our client app so that server can serve them
# and then restart our server , i.e. run 'dotnet run' so that server takes new static files

[some error during seeding]






# Whenever we drop the DB, when we run 'dotnet run', we automatically seed our DB (since it was just dropped), and if we get some error during seeding (which we then fix), it also means our DB was only partially seeded before. So, after each such case, we need to manually drop the DB again so that it will be empty, and so, it will then be again seeded (now hopefully without errors, otherwise this step will need to be repeated):
